## Why SnapSafe?

**SnapSafe** is a camera app that has been engineered from the ground up to protect your photos.

Attacks come in many forms, from accidental swipes, to intrusive surveillance, and even malicious code.
**SnapSafe** can protect your photos from all angles.

### Key Features

* 🔒 **Zero‑Leak Design** – The app has no internet access; android backups are prevented..
* 🛡️ **Fully Encrypted** – Shots are written to encrypted, app‑private storage.
* 🔢 **PIN‑Locked Gallery** – A separate PIN stands between curious thumbs and your photos.
* 📤 **Secure Sharing** – Metadata is scrubbed and filenames are randomized when you share.
* 😶‍🌫️ **Auto-Face Blur** – Obfuscate faces automatically with our secure blur algorithm.
* 🗺️ **Granular Location** – Add coarse, fine, or zero location data—your call.
* ☠️ **Poison Pill** – Set a special PIN, that when entered, appears to work normally but actually deletes your existing
  photos.
* 🎭 **Decoy Photos** – Select innocuous decoy photos, these will be preserved when your Poison Pill is activated.
* 👀 **100 % Open Source** – Auditable code in plain sight.

### On the Roadmap

* Encrypted video recording. _Maybe._
* Improved photo-taking experience
